Regression analysis for salary prediction is a data science technique used to model the relationship between independent variables and a continuous target variable, such as salary. 
This code snippet utilizes Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. 
Regression models including RandomForestRegressor, AdaBoostRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, and KNeighborsRegressor are employed to predict salaries based on various features
from the DS_Salaries dataset
